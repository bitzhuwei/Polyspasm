Polyspasm is a demo I created in late 2012 for the course
EDAN35 High Performance Computer Graphics.

The code is written in C++ and is quite ugly due to the time requirements
that I was working with.

The song used is Kung Fu Goldfish by Linus "lft" Åkesson.
Parts of the Minecraft map Broville v10 by oldshoes are also used in the demo.
